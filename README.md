# Multiple Linear Regression with PySpark

This repository demonstrates how to perform Multiple Linear Regression using PySpark. It provides example code, explanations, and workflow for building, training, and evaluating a regression model on large datasets using Apache Spark's MLlib library.


## Overview

Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. PySpark's MLlib enables scalable machine learning on big data and can be used to efficiently perform regression analysis on large datasets.

This project covers:
- Data preprocessing using PySpark DataFrame API
- Feature engineering and vectorization
- Building and training a Multiple Linear Regression model
- Model evaluation with metrics like RMSE and RÂ²
- Example scripts/notebooks for demonstration

## Features

- End-to-end pipeline for regression modeling
- Support for large datasets (scalable with Spark)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering steps
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Example code for reproducibility

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploration)
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt` if present)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alinapradhan/-Multiple_Linear_Regression_PySpark.git
   cd -Multiple_Linear_Regression_PySpark
   ```

2. Install PySpark:
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark
   ```

3. (Optional) Install other dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start a Python script or Jupyter notebook.
2. Import and initialize Spark session:
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
   spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MultipleLinearRegression").getOrCreate()
   ```
3. Load your dataset and follow the steps in the sample code:
   - Data loading & cleaning
   - Feature assembly using `VectorAssembler`
   - Model training with `LinearRegression`
   - Model evaluation

4. Example script is available in `main.py` or notebook files.
